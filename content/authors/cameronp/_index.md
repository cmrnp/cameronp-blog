I work as a statistical consultant, working with researchers at the University of
Melbourne as well as clients outside the University. This can involve all stages
of quantitative research: designing experiments or surveys, planning an appropriate
analysis, analysing data, making graphs and communicating results clearly in
papers or reports.

My blog here is a collection of my thoughts as a practicing statistician. Some of
my posts are intended as resources for clients. Other posts will be more of interest
to fellow statisticians.

When I'm not thinking about statistics, I try to spend time out in nature:
hiking, trail running, cycling, or camping.
