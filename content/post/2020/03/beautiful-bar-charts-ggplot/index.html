<p>Bar charts (or bar graphs) are commonly used, but they’re also a simple type of
graph where the defaults in ggplot leave a lot to be desired. This is a
step-by-step description of how I’d go about improving them, describing the
thought processess along the way. Every plot is different and the
decisions you make need to reflect the message you’re trying to convey, so don’t
treat this post as a recipe, treat it as some points to consider—and
hopefully, a few tips that will help you achieve the look you want in your own plots.</p>
<p>For this blog post, I’m going to use the number of seats won by each political
party in the 2018 Victorian state election as an example. This data was obtained from
<a href="https://www.vec.vic.gov.au/Results/State2018/Summary.html">the Victorian Electoral Commission</a>.
Victorians may remember this election being described as a “Danslide”, where
Labor, led by Premier Daniel Andrews, won a clear majority of seats.</p>
<p>Here’s the data as an R command you can paste if you want to try making these
plots yourself:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>election_data &lt;- tribble(
                    ~party, ~seats_won,
       &quot;Australian Greens&quot;,          3,
  &quot;Australian Labor Party&quot;,         55,
                 &quot;Liberal&quot;,         21,
           &quot;The Nationals&quot;,          6,
        &quot;Other Candidates&quot;,          3
)</code></pre>
<p>The first decision to make when you’re thinking of making a bar chart is whether
you’d be better off using a different type of plot entirely. Bar charts are most
suitable for displaying counts, percentages or other quantities where zero has a
special meaning. If you make a bar chart, your axis should always start at zero,
or the area of the bar gives a misleading visual impression. Other ways of
representing data, such as box plots or points with error bars, may be more
appropriate for quantities
where zero is not an important reference point. If you are representing time
series data (repeated observations made over time), a continuous line (perhaps
with points at the the times where observations were made) is almost always better
than a sequence of bars.</p>
<p>The second decision to make is which axis to put the categorical variable and
which axis to put the numerical variable. Having the categories on the <em>y</em> axis
often works best. It gives you more space when you have either
a large number of categories or categories with long labels.</p>
<p>A lot of software either makes it more difficult to put categories on the <em>y</em>
axis, or requires you to change a setting away from the default. This used to be
the case for ggplot, but as of version 3.3.0, you just need to tell it which
variable goes on which axis, and it will figure out the rest:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(election_data,
       aes(x = seats_won, y = party)) +
  geom_col()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020/03/beautiful-bar-charts-ggplot/index_files/figure-html/barchart1-1.png" width="720" /></p>
<p>The bar chart above is a good starting point, but quite a few things could be
improved. The order of the categories is a bit odd: from top to bottom, it’s in
reverse alphabetical order. This is the default in ggplot, but it is almost
never what you want. The easiest way
to change this is to give the option <code>limits = rev</code> to the <em>y</em> axis scale
(this is also new in ggplot version 3.3.0):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(election_data,
       aes(x = seats_won, y = party)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020/03/beautiful-bar-charts-ggplot/index_files/figure-html/barchart2-1.png" width="720" /></p>
<p>In this particular case, alphabetical ordering isn’t the best choice.
It’s often best to order categories from most common to least common, or from
most to least in the variable you’re displaying (e.g. most to least seats won).
There are two functions in the <code>forcats</code> package which can help with this:
<code>fct_infreq</code> orders the level of a factor by how frequently they occur in the
data, and <code>fct_reorder</code> orders the level of a factor by the values of a
different variable.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>election_data_sorted &lt;- election_data %&gt;%
  mutate(party = fct_reorder(party, seats_won, .desc = TRUE))</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(election_data_sorted,
       aes(x = seats_won, y = party)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020/03/beautiful-bar-charts-ggplot/index_files/figure-html/barchart3-1.png" width="720" /></p>
<p>If I was doing exploratory data analysis, or making a quick plot to show a
colleague, I might stop at this point. But there is still plenty of room for
improvement. To start with, the axis labels are the variable names in our data
frame, which is better than no labels at all, but are usually too brief or
jargon-laden for a wider audience. A good plot can be interpreted clearly with
as little supporting information as possible—remember that a reader’s eye will
be drawn to a large, colourful figure and ignore the paragraphs of text
you’ve written describing the full context.</p>
<p>I’ve also changed the origin of the <em>x</em> axis so the bars are hard against the
axis. Putting a blank space to the left of zero on a bar chart is something
I’ve only ever seen in ggplot. It’s caused by ggplot’s standard rule of adding
10% padding on either side of the biggest and smallest values plotted. You can
turn it off by setting the <code>expand</code> option on the <em>x</em> axis scale.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(election_data_sorted,
       aes(x = seats_won, y = party)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))) +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev) +
  labs(x = &quot;Number of seats won&quot;,
       y = &quot;Party&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020/03/beautiful-bar-charts-ggplot/index_files/figure-html/barchart4-1.png" width="720" /></p>
<p>The grey background with white gridlines is a very distinctive ggplot default.
Sometimes it works well—it can reduce the visual noise of gridlines in complex
plots—but in this case I would normally opt for a simpler. I often use
<code>theme_bw</code> or <code>theme_minimal</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(election_data_sorted,
       aes(x = seats_won, y = party)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))) +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev) +
  labs(x = &quot;Number of seats won&quot;,
       y = &quot;Party&quot;) +
  theme_bw()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020/03/beautiful-bar-charts-ggplot/index_files/figure-html/barchart5-1.png" width="720" /></p>
<p>The gridlines on the <em>x</em> axis are useful guides to the eye, but for a categorical
variable with only a few categories, the gridlines only introduce clutter. They
can be removed using the <code>theme</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(election_data_sorted,
       aes(x = seats_won, y = party)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))) +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev) +
  labs(x = &quot;Number of seats won&quot;,
       y = &quot;Party&quot;) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020/03/beautiful-bar-charts-ggplot/index_files/figure-html/barchart6-1.png" width="720" /></p>
<p>The default dark grey bars look a bit drab. You can choose a colour and give
it as an option to <code>geom_col</code>. If you’re like me, you’ll probably try a couple
of wrong things first: either passing the colour inside <code>aes()</code> (won’t work,
because the colour will be interpreted as data to plot) or using <code>colour</code> instead
of <code>fill</code> (which changes the border colour instead). You can either use
a hexadecimal colour code (like in HTML), or one of <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf">a number of built-in
colour names</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(election_data_sorted,
       aes(x = seats_won, y = party)) +
  geom_col(fill = &quot;darkorchid&quot;) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))) +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev) +
  labs(x = &quot;Number of seats won&quot;,
       y = &quot;Party&quot;) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020/03/beautiful-bar-charts-ggplot/index_files/figure-html/barchart7-1.png" width="720" /></p>
<p>In this context, it would be conventional to colour the bars based on the party
being represented. Here I’ve set <code>fill = party</code>, then given a manual scale for
the fill based on party colours found on Wikipedia. I also disabled the legend,
which isn’t necessary in this instance—the party names are already next to the
bars. I’ve also added a title and a caption indicating the source of the data;
these wouldn’t normally be included in an academic publication but are a very
good idea for a plot which might be copied out of context.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(election_data_sorted,
       aes(x = seats_won, y = party, fill = party)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))) +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev) +
  scale_fill_manual(breaks = c(&quot;Australian Labor Party&quot;, &quot;Liberal&quot;, &quot;The Nationals&quot;,
                               &quot;Australian Greens&quot;, &quot;Other Candidates&quot;),
                    values = c(&quot;#DE3533&quot;, &quot;#0047AB&quot;, &quot;#006644&quot;,
                               &quot;#10C25B&quot;, &quot;#808080&quot;)) +
  labs(x = &quot;Number of seats won&quot;,
       y = &quot;Party&quot;,
       title = &quot;Victorian election 2018 lower house results&quot;,
       caption = &quot;Data source: Victorian Electoral Commission&quot;) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
        legend.position = &quot;off&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020/03/beautiful-bar-charts-ggplot/index_files/figure-html/barchart8-1.png" width="720" /></p>
<p>Depending on what you’re trying to show with the graph, you may want to add
annotations beyond what is contained in the original data. For example, you
could add a dashed line at 44 seats indicating the number required for a
party to form a majority government (which could slightly misleading, since the
Liberal and National parties govern in coalition). In ggplot, you can pass
specific data to any <code>geom_</code> function; in this example I’m using <code>geom_vline</code>
to draw the dashed line and <code>geom_text</code> to draw the label:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(election_data_sorted,
       aes(x = seats_won, y = party, fill = party)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 44, linetype = 2, colour = &quot;grey20&quot;) +
  geom_text(x = 45, y = 4, label = &quot;majority of\nparliament&quot;, 
            hjust = 0, size = 11 * 0.8 / .pt, colour = &quot;grey20&quot;) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))) +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev) +
  scale_fill_manual(breaks = c(&quot;Australian Labor Party&quot;, &quot;Liberal&quot;, &quot;The Nationals&quot;,
                               &quot;Australian Greens&quot;, &quot;Other Candidates&quot;),
                    values = c(&quot;#DE3533&quot;, &quot;#0047AB&quot;, &quot;#006644&quot;,
                               &quot;#10C25B&quot;, &quot;#808080&quot;)) +
  labs(x = &quot;Number of seats won&quot;,
       y = &quot;Party&quot;,
       title = &quot;Victorian election 2018 lower house results&quot;,
       caption = &quot;Data source: Victorian Electoral Commission&quot;) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
        legend.position = &quot;off&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020/03/beautiful-bar-charts-ggplot/index_files/figure-html/barchart8b-1.png" width="720" /></p>
<p>Finally, another good option for representing the same type of data as a bar
chart is a line with a point at the end. The point draws the eye to the end of
the line, which is the actual value being represented. You can create this in
ggplot by using a <code>geom_segment</code> to draw the line segment and <code>geom_point</code> to
draw the point. You also need to give <code>xend</code> and <code>yend</code> for <code>geom_segment</code> to
work—it’s a general function for drawing line segments, not a specific
functon for creating this type of plot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(election_data_sorted,
       aes(x = seats_won,
           xend = 0,
           y = party,
           yend = party,
           colour = party)) +
  geom_segment() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))) +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev) +
  scale_colour_manual(breaks = c(&quot;Australian Labor Party&quot;, &quot;Liberal&quot;, &quot;The Nationals&quot;,
                                 &quot;Australian Greens&quot;, &quot;Other Candidates&quot;),
                      values = c(&quot;#DE3533&quot;, &quot;#0047AB&quot;, &quot;#006644&quot;,
                                 &quot;#10C25B&quot;, &quot;#808080&quot;)) +
  labs(x = &quot;Number of seats won&quot;,
       y = &quot;Party&quot;,
       title = &quot;Victorian election 2018 lower house results&quot;,
       caption = &quot;Data source: Victorian Electoral Commission&quot;) +
  theme(legend.position = &quot;off&quot;)</code></pre>
