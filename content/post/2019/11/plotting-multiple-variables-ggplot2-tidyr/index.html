<p>In exploratory data analysis, it’s common to want to make similar
plots of a number of variables at once. For example, a randomised trial may
look at several outcomes, or a survey may have a large number of questions. Some
packages—for example, Minitab—make it easy to put several variables on the
same plot with an option for “multiple Ys”. Here is a way to achieve
the same thing using R and <code>ggplot2</code>.</p>

<h2>Pivoting longer: turning your variables into rows</h2>
<p><code>ggplot2</code> doesn’t provide an easy facility to plot multiple variables
at once because this is usually a sign that <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html">your data is not “tidy”</a>. For example, in situations where you want
to plot two columns on a graph as points with different colours, the two
columns often really represent the same variable, and there is a hidden
grouping factor which distinguishes the data points you want to colour differently.
The usual answer in this scenario is that you
should restructure your data before plotting it. As a bonus, it will probably be
easier to analyse your data in that form too.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you want to split a plot into panels (or
facets, in <code>ggplot2</code>-speak),
you must plot a single response variable, with a grouping variable to indicate
which panel the data should be plotted in.
The best structure for your data depends
on what you’re trying to do with it, and in this situation, even if your data
is in the right form for analysis, it may not be right for some of the plots you want
to make.</p>
<p>Fortunately, restructuring your data into the right form is straightforward using the <code>tidyr</code>
package and the <code>pivot_longer()</code> function. In this example, I’m going to look at some
mocked-up survey data, with six questions stored in variables <code>Q1</code> through <code>Q6</code>.
The original data frame looks like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>print(survey_data)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 300 x 7
##    group    Q1    Q2    Q3    Q4    Q5    Q6
##    &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;
##  1 B         4     1     4     1     2     3
##  2 B         5     2     5     4     3     3
##  3 B         5     4     4     2     2     3
##  4 B         5     1     5     2     4     3
##  5 A         5     2     5     1     1     2
##  6 A         5     3     5     3     2     2
##  7 A         4     3     5     1     4     1
##  8 B         4     3     5     1     2     1
##  9 B         4     4     4     1     3     2
## 10 B         4     4     5     2     5     4
## # ... with 290 more rows</code></pre>
<p>You can convert this into a
longer data frame where the question number is stored in one column and the
response is stored in a separate column:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>longer_data &lt;- survey_data %&gt;%
  pivot_longer(Q1:Q6, names_to = &quot;question&quot;, values_to = &quot;response&quot;)
print(longer_data)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1,800 x 3
##    group question response
##    &lt;fct&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt;
##  1 B     Q1              4
##  2 B     Q2              1
##  3 B     Q3              4
##  4 B     Q4              1
##  5 B     Q5              2
##  6 B     Q6              3
##  7 B     Q1              5
##  8 B     Q2              2
##  9 B     Q3              5
## 10 B     Q4              4
## # ... with 1,790 more rows</code></pre>
<p>You don’t even need to store the ‘long form’ data as a separate variable. If you’re
not going to use the data in this form for anything else, it’s
simpler to pipe the data straight into <code>ggplot2</code>. Here I use the <code>facet_wrap()</code>
function to plot each question in a separate panel, so we can see the distribution
of all of the questions at once:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>survey_data %&gt;%
  pivot_longer(Q1:Q6, names_to = &quot;question&quot;, values_to = &quot;response&quot;) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = response)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(vars(question), ncol = 3) +
  labs(x = &quot;Response (on a 1 to 5 scale)&quot;, y = &quot;Number of respondents&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019/11/plotting-multiple-variables-ggplot2-tidyr/index_files/figure-html/panel-plot-1.png" width="720" /></p>
<p>You can use <code>question</code> as a factor anywhere else you would use a categorical
variable with ggplot. For example, you can make some box plots:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>survey_data %&gt;%
  pivot_longer(Q1:Q6, names_to = &quot;question&quot;, values_to = &quot;response&quot;) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(y = response, x = question)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = &quot;Question&quot;, y = &quot;Response (on a 1 to 5 scale)&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019/11/plotting-multiple-variables-ggplot2-tidyr/index_files/figure-html/box-plot-1.png" width="720" /></p>
<p>This is also a nice demonstration of how box plots are rarely the best way to
present Likert scale data.</p>
<p>Any other variables are retained after you call <code>pivot_longer()</code>, so you can
e.g. compare the responses to survey questions based on a demographic variable:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>survey_data %&gt;%
  pivot_longer(Q1:Q6, names_to = &quot;question&quot;, values_to = &quot;response&quot;) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = response, colour = group)) +
  facet_wrap(vars(question), ncol = 3) +
  geom_point(stat = &quot;count&quot;) +
  geom_line(stat = &quot;count&quot;) +
  labs(x = &quot;Response (on a 1 to 5 scale)&quot;, y = &quot;Number of respondents&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019/11/plotting-multiple-variables-ggplot2-tidyr/index_files/figure-html/line-plot-1.png" width="720" /></p>
<p>By default, R will sort the levels of factors alphabetically. This isn’t always
what you want in this situation—often the order of the variables in your data
frame has some meaning to it. The <code>fct_inorder()</code> function allows you to reorder
levels of a factor in the order of first appearance in the file. If you use that
with the column produced by <code>pivot_longer()</code>, the factor will be ordered by the
order of the columns in the original data frame.</p>
