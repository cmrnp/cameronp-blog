<p>Data that has some kind of hierarchical structure to it is very common in many
fields, but is rarely discussed in introductory statistics courses. Terms used to
describe this kind of data include hierarchical data, multi-level data, longitudinal
data, split-plot designs or repeated measures designs. Statistical models used for
these types of data include mixed-effects models (often abbreviated to just <em>mixed models</em>),
repeated measures ANOVA and generalised estimating equations (GEEs).</p>
<p>All of these terms and models arose from different contexts, but they share a common
feature. Observations are not independent, as many classical statistical methods
assume, and there is structure to the dependence which can be
incorporated into a statistical model.</p>
<p><strong>Using a statistical model which doesn’t account for the hierarchical nature
of this data will give incorrect results.</strong></p>

<h2>Common examples of hierarchical data</h2>
<p>Data with two levels of variation often arise when multiple measurements are
made on the same units of observation. In the case of designed experiments,
treatments may also be assigned to different levels of the hierarchy. Factors
are commonly described as <em>within</em>-subject (varying at the lowest level) or
<em>between</em>-subject (varying at a higher level). Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measurements made on the same people at several points in time. This is often
called longitudinal data. In this example, time would be a within-subject factor
and most other variables of interest—e.g., treatment, age or gender—would be
between-subject.</li>
<li>Measurements made at different depths of a number of rock core samples. In this example,
the depths would be a within-subject factor and the location where the sample was obtained
would be a between-subject factor.</li>
<li>Assigning different treatments to different legs, arms or eyes of a number of people.
For example, one eye may be given a new drug and the other eye a placebo. In this
example, treatment is a within-subject factor.</li>
<li>A split-plot experiment in agriculture: splitting plots of land into sections,
planting different crops in each section, and using different irrigation methods
on different plots. In this example, variety is a within-plot factor and irrigation
is a between-plot factor.</li>
<li>A split-mouth design in dentistry: assigning different treatments to different
parts of participants’ mouths.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to have more than two levels of variation. Some examples from
different fields of research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students within classrooms within schools.</li>
<li>Repeated surveys administered to individuals within organisations.</li>
<li>Glands within lesions within patients.</li>
<li>Blocks of land divided into plots divided into subplots.</li>
</ul>
<p>In situations with multiple levels, it is common to describe variables based on the
level at which they are measured or assigned, e.g. student-level, classroom-level or
school-level.</p>

<div id="random-effects" class="section level2">
<h2>Random effects</h2>
<p>Multi-level data is commonly modelled using <em>mixed-effects models</em>, which get their
name because they have both fixed effects and random effects. Fixed effects are
the kind of explanatory variables you may be used to in ANOVA or linear regression: you
would like to directly estimate the effect of these variables on your outcome. For
example: treatment (drug or placebo) and time; crop variety and irrigation;
depth and location of rock core samples.
In these examples, the random effects would be the variables which group together correlated
observations: participants in a trial; plots of land; rock core samples.</p>
<p>Here are two different ways to think about random effects:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Random effects are factors where the individual levels are random samples from
a larger population, or can be thought of in this way.</li>
<li>Random effects are factors where you don’t care about the actual effect they
have on your outcome, just their ability to account for correlation between
observations.</li>
</ol>
<p>For a random effect, instead of estimating the effect of each specific level of
the factor (e.g. each individual in a study), the model estimates the variance
explained by that factor.
This is sometimes reported as the proportion of variation explained at each level,
e.g. 63% of variance was at the individual level.</p>
<p>Random effects can be “nested” inside other random effects if there are more than
two levels of variation. For example, “classroom within school” could be specified
as a random effect.</p>

<div id="simpler-analysis-options" class="section level2">
<h2>Simpler analysis options</h2>
<p>As a practical consideration, random effects work best when they have a reasonable
number of different levels. It may be better to treat a factor which is conceptually
random as a fixed effect instead in some cases; e.g. if you are studying students
from two or three schools, school should probably be a fixed effect rather than
a random effect. There are also situations where this approach is not appropriate.</p>
<p>It is sometimes possible to simplify an analysis if there are no variables which
distinguish individuals at a particular level. For example, consider an experiment in
which treatments were randomly assigned to litters of pigs but measurements were made on
individual pigs, with no pig-level variables (e.g. sex) of interest in
the analysis. In this situation, analysing litter averages would be a simpler analysis
providing the same results as the mixed model.</p>

<div id="study-design-considerations" class="section level2">
<h2>Study design considerations</h2>
<p>Effects at the lowest level of the hierarchy (e.g. within-subject) are usually estimated
more precisely than effects at higher levels (e.g. between-subject). Or equivalently,
tests of within-subject effects tend to be more powerful than tests of between-subject
effects. One intuition about this is that there are more observations at the lowest level
(e.g. number of subplots) than there are at higher levels (e.g. number of plots).
Another way to look at this is that for within-subject factors, each individual
unit of observation is effectively their own control.</p>
